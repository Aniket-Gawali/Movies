      <h2>Shaniwar Wada History : </h2>
      <p>Shaniwar Wada was built by Peshwa Baji Rao I, a general under Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj of the Maratha Empire. He laid the foundation of the site in 1730 and the construction was completed in 1732. Initially, it was intended to be a colossal seven-storied palace made of stones. However, after the construction of the base floor, the people of the national capital complained to the king that only he was authorized to build stone palaces. Consequently, the remaining floors were constructed using bricks. The full impact of this was felt when the British artillery attacked the palace 90 years after its construction. Except for the base floor which was constructed using stones, no other floor could stand the attack and all the top stories collapsed.</p>
      <p>Over the years after its construction, the Peshwas made many additions to the mansion, such as fortification walls with gateways and bastions, reservoirs, court halls, fountains, and other structures. The palace was also a witness to several significant episodes in the history of the Peshwas. In 1773, the fifth Peshwa, Narayan Rao, was murdered inside this palace by his guards at the behest of Raghunath Rao, his uncle and Anandibai, his aunt. That’s not all! It was also the site where the romance between Peshwa Bajirao and Mastani Sahiba blossomed.</p>
      <p>In 1818, the British East India Company gained control over the Wada following their win in the Third Anglo-Maratha War. On 27th February 1828, the palace was engulfed by a huge unexplained fire, causing extensive damage to the whole structure. After the fire doused, only the massive granite ramparts, deep foundations, and a few teak gateways and erections remained of the grand mansion. The structures that survived this massive fire outbreak are currently maintained as a tourist site.</p>
      <h2>Shaniwar Wada: Architecture : </h2>
      <p>Shaniwar Wada features the Maratha Imperial architectural style. For the construction, teak was sourced from the Junnar jungles while lime was brought from the Jejuri lime belts and stones from the Chinchwad quarries.</h4>
      <p>The fortification wall of the palace had five entry points and nine bastion towers. The palace was designed with intricately carved teak doorways, exquisitely designed teak pillars, and marble floors. Scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata adorned its walls while glass chandeliers hung from the ceilings. Within the palace complex, the Ganpati Rang Mahal was erected as a separate place for observing religious functions. It had a massive statue of Lord Ganesha.</p>
      <p>A majestic fountain shaped like a lotus, called Hazari Karanje or the Fountain of a Thousand Jets, adorned the palace complex. It is believed to have been the most exquisite fountain of that era whose jets formed 80 feet-high arches. The Thorlya Rayancha Diwankhana or the court reception hall of Baji Rao I, the Juna Arsa Mahal or the Mirror Hall, and the Naachacha Diwankhana or the Dance Hall were some of the other splendid structures that existed within the palace.</p>
      <h2>Shaniwar Wada: Today </h2>
      <p>Though Shaniwar Wada is a ruined structure now, it is still one of the best<b style="color: blue;"places> to visit in Pune.</b> Although the mansion covered nearly the whole city in its heyday, it currently spreads across 625 acres</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Shaniwar Wada is considered to be among the top<b style="color: blue;"> haunted places in Pune.</b> It is believed that the spirit of the murdered Peshwa, Narayan Rao, still roams the palace at night. The light and sound show held here in the evening is also a major attraction for visitors.</p>
      <p>It is interesting to note that the old part of Pune is laid out around Shaniwar Wada in a chaotic yet orderlymanner. You can also find some of the oldest markets in Pune, such as Tulshibaug, Laxmi Road, and Ravivar Peth, around this grand edifice.</p>

      <h2>Shaniwar Wada: Light and Sound Show</h2>

        <li>If locals are to be believed, Peshwa Narayan Rao’s wails saying ‘kaka mala wachawa (uncle save me)’ can be heard even &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today on full moon nights.</li>
        <li>The palace was featured in one of the episodes of The Amazing Race Asia 3, a television reality show.</li>
        <li>It was also featured in the 2015 Bollywood blockbuster<i> Bajirao Mastani.</i></li>
        <li>The main gate of the palace is so big that elephants can easily pass through it. However,to prevent the enemies from using &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elephants to charge the gate, sharp steel spikes were attached to each pane of the gate at an approximate height of an adult &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elephant’s forehead.</li>
